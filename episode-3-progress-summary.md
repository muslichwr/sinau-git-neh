🎓 Key Learnings
Git Remote Workflow:
# Daily pattern
git pull          # Morning: get updates
[coding...]
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git pull          # Before push: check updates
git push          # Upload
Collaboration Golden Rules:
ALWAYS pull before push
Pull frequently (minimize conflicts)
Commit small & often
Clear commit messages
Coordinate who edits what files
Use branches for big features
Conflict Resolution Pattern:
git pull                    # Conflict detected
git status                  # See conflicted files
# Edit file manually (remove markers)
git add <file>             # Mark resolved
git commit                 # Create merge commit
git push                   # Upload resolution
Security:
.gitignore protects secrets from being uploaded
Pattern: *.env, .env, secrets.env
Verify: File exists locally but NOT in GitHub
Critical for API keys, passwords, tokens
